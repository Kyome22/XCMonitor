## Issues

2. Click `New issue` and select the `Bug Report` template.
3. Follow all checklist steps and confirm that the bug still occurs.
4. Provide clear and complete information. More details help maintainers resolve the issue faster.
5. Submit the issue and stay attentive, as maintainers may request additional information.

### Feature Requests

To suggest a new feature:

1. Check if a similar feature request already exists.  
   If so, please contribute to the existing discussion instead of opening a new one.
2. Ensure your suggestion benefits a broad range of users and is not only a personal preference.
3. Click `New issue` and select the `Feature Request` template.
4. Fill out the template as clearly and completely as possible.
5. Submit the issue and remain available for follow-up questions.

## Code Style Guidelines

All style rules are defined in [CODING_STYLE.md](CODING_STYLE.md).
Follow them together with the existing conventions in the codebase.

---

## Review Process

- Pull requests are reviewed as time permits.
- Not all contributions are guaranteed to be accepted.
- Maintainers may request changes before merging.
- Inactive or non-responsive pull requests may be closed.

### Community Reviews

- Reviews and comments from non-maintainer community members are welcome and appreciated.
- However, **only feedback from maintainers is considered official**, and only maintainers decide whether a pull request is merged.
- Community reviewers may not be fully familiar with this project's contribution guidelines, so their suggestions may not always align with project policy.
- Contributors are free to consider community feedback, but should use their own judgment and wait for maintainer review before treating any change as required.

### Responding to Review Comments

- **Do not click `Resolve conversation` unless you are the reviewer.**
  Even after pushing a fix in response to a review comment, only the reviewer can decide whether the issue is actually resolved.
  Pushing a follow-up commit and resolving the conversation yourself bypasses that judgment.
- **Address each review comment individually rather than bundling them together**, unless there is a clear reason to combine them.
  The larger a single response or diff becomes, the harder it is for the reviewer to evaluate whether each point has been handled correctly.
  Reply to each comment with the corresponding change so that the discussion stays focused and easy to follow.
